When all else fails, Google can often save you! Chances are, if you're experiencing a problem or don't know how to do something, you're not alone. Try Googling your problem. If you have an error message try googling the salient keywords in the error. 

I often joke that I am not actually a programmer, but a professional googler. However, in all seriousness, virtually all knowledge about programming in Java is somewhere on the internet. If you know how to ask the question you should be able to find the answer.
