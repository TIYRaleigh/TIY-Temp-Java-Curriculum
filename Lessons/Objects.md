If a class in Java is a blueprint, then what you build from that blueprint is called an _object_.

**Classes are to blueprints as objects are to houses.**

A blueprint doesn't provide much shelter or storage space; it doesn't _do_ much of anything other than tell us how to build a house. It's essentially _metadata_; data that describes other data.

On the other hand, a house _does_ provide shelter and storage space. However, it doesn't tell you how to build another house. 

A class doesn't do the "magic bits" (not a technical term). You have to use the class to create an object that does the magic bits. Each object you create from a class is said to be an _instance_ of that object.
