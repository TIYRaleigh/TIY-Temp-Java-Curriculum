So far we've only dealt with individual instances of objects. In our `Main` class we had two instances of the `Person` class. But what if you had 100 instances? What if you wanted to give each instance a high five? Would you write out 100 duplicate lines of code, one for each instance? No, of course you wouldn't! This is where _collections_ come in.

Collections are groups of objects that we can work with. One type of collection is an Array. Arrays are ordered lists of objects. For example, your to-do list or web browser history could be arrays.
