In this class we will be using IntelliJ Ultimate. IntelliJ is (in my opinion) the best all-around IDE, especially for Java. It offers all of the features previously discussed and innumerable other features.

### Create a new Project

Unless otherwise indicated, for each assignment in this class we will need to create a new project in IntelliJ.  A project is a collection of source code, tests, and other resources that make up a software project. 

To create a new project in IntelliJ you do the following:

<!-- todo: demonstrate how to create a new project. -->

If you don't have any projects open in IntelliJ you will see a window like this:

Just click to Create New Project.

If you do have a project open, you can use the File > New > Project... menu. Both options start the same process.

In the New Project dialog that pops up, select Java in the top left corner. There will be many other options to choose from, but this is all you need right now. On the right side of the dialog set the Project SDK to 1.8, as we configured during the install party. Click Next.

Click Next again to skip the next page of options.

Finally, give your project a name. In general, in this class, I'll give you a name for your project. If not, then try to give the project a reasonable name.

You can use the default folder that IntelliJ wants to put your projects in, if you'd like. I personally prefer using a folder named `Projects` under my user directory. It's up to you.
