Unit tests are only useful if you actually run them. In general, you should run your tests after every time you save a file. This will give you immediate feedback to make sure the changes you've made work and didn't break something else. 

Since you will want to run your tests frequently, you will want to make sure they run very quickly. Pay attention to tests that run slowly and see if you can find a way to make them faster. Later on in the class we will talk about stubs and mocks which can be used to help improve your tests and make them run better, and can even help improve the quality of  your overall application architecture.
