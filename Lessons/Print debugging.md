You won't always be able to just look at an exception and know what's going wrong. Sometimes bugs are buried deep in code and present themselves as unexpected (emergent) behaviors.

Print debugging is as simple as using `System.out.println()` to print messages out to the console. By strategically printing out information you can gain insight into what your program is really doing as it executes. We've already been using print debugging throughout this class. 

<!-- todo: come up with a contrived example of print debugging -->
