Software is often used to _model_ objects in the physical world. Abstract concepts can also modeled. 

In the real (or abstract) world, objects have properties. Properties are how you describe things. A property of the sky is that it's blue. A property of a laptop is what CPU it has. A property of a tweet is the actual text of the tweet.

In the real (or abstract) world, objects have capabilities. A gun can shoot. A person can sleep. A transaction can transfer money between two bank accounts.

In this context, the word model can be confusing. Intuitively, you may think of a model airplane or rocket, or a fashion model, or a specific type of car. In programming, a model is like a mental model - how you think about something. If you've taken higher level math courses, you may have learned how differential equations can be used to model real world problems. Programatic models are a similar concept.

One relevant dictionary definition of model is,

> a simplified description, especially a mathematical one, of a system or process, to assist calculations and predictions.

Allow me to ask a few questions of you:

### What _is_ the desktop on your computer? 

Is it a real desk on which you can set your cup of coffee? Are those real folders you can stick a piece of paper in?

Desktops are a digital metaphor for a physical object. Desktops have various attributes such as a background picture, folders, files, and short cuts. It has capabilities. It can move organize folders and files, launch applications, switch to different views, display widgets, and more.

Video game characters are a computer model of a fantasy. This model has properties such as health, inventory, and a location in a virtual world. It has capabilities such as fighting, talking, and picking things up. These capabilities can change the character's own properties. For example, picking up a new weapon may enable a new type of attack.

### What _is_ an online purchase?

You can buy anything on Amazon. This is obviously a financial transaction. Is real money exchanged? Can you hold a financial transaction in your hand?

Online transactions are a computer representation of financial transactions in the real world. An online transaction isn't physical; you can't point at anything and say _that_ is my transaction. But, you can describe it; what was purchased, the total cost, where to ship it, etc. A transaction transfers funds from your credit card to the online retailer's bank account.

### What _is_ a tweet?

It's 140 characters. It's a post on Twitter. But, can you hold it in your hand? What does it smell like?

A tweet is an abstract, incorporeal, message. But, it has attributes that describe it's length, the textual content of the tweet, the number of times it's been retweeted or favorited.
