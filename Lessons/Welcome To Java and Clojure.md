### The Learning Process

You may find that the first few days or week of material are easy. Don't let this lull you into a false sence of security. Things are going to get tough.

This image comes from Tim Ferriss' book The 4 Hour Chef and describes his experiences when learning a foreign language. Your experiences learning Java will mirror Tim's experience learning French.

Each month on the graph above corresponds to roughly a week and a half in this class. You can expect to start out rapidly learning fun and exciting new skills. Think of this as the **sugar high**.

And, just like with a sugar high, you can expect a **crash**. This is when you realize that you've only scratched the surface of a gigantic concept. This is where you **really start learning**. Your brain will begin to literally change at a physical level as new neural connections are created.

The next phase is a long slog. You may feel like you're **plateauing**, but keep going. At some point you'll reach an inflection point where these concepts start to come together. This is the turning point where you start heading towards technical **fluency**.

### Mindset

Come to class in a mindset to learn and grow. Don't say "I'm not good at math." Instead say, "I'm not good at math, _yet_." Even better, say "I'm working to become better at math."

[Read about the growth mindset here.](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

Try to determine how you learn best. Do you learn by hearing? Do you learn by seeing? Do you learn by reading? Do you learn by doing? Perhaps a combination of these? Find your strengths and exploit them.

* Demand what you need. Interrupt me.
* Intentionally decide to be engaged.
* Don't be afraid to ask questions.

### Class Organization

This class has been intentionally designed - with scientific research in mind - to help you learn these new concepts very quickly. It has been shown, for example, that humans remember the beginnings and ends of lists better than the middle. In this class, we'll try to make our "lists" shorter.

![shorter lists.png](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/07089a20-shorter%20lists.png)

In this class I will endeavor to switch topics every 45 minutes or so and take breaks between two 90 minute morning lectures.

### Ask Good Questions

While there are no dumb questions, there are good questions. [Read about how to ask good questions.](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

If you aren't asking questions, you either aren't involved, paying attention, or you aren't understanding enough to ask a question. Asking questions is a muscle, and you need to exercise that muscle!

### Ask Dumb Questions

Don't be afraid to make a fool of yourself.

Assume everyone here has the same question as you, but is too afraid to ask it. By asking your question, you help yourself _and_ everyone else, including me.

### Taking Notes

Taking notes in class won't help you if you take down the wrong notes.

I suggest that after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, you take a short moment to write down the most important points. Much of what you might want to make notes of are available in Tiyo already.

The hardest part of learning to code is not writing notes, but using and mastering the combinations of code you cover in class.

### The Dreyfus Model

[The Dreyfus Model](http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA084551&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf) describes five steps that self directed learners go through. In summary these are:

1. **Novice** This is you right now.
    * Rigid adherence to rules or plans
    * Little situational perception
    * No (or limited) discretionary judgment
1. **Advanced Beginner**
    * Guidelines for action based on attributes and aspects, which are all equal and separate
    * Limited situational perception
1. **Competent** This is where I want you to end.
    * Conscious deliberate planning
    * Standardized and routine procedures
1. **Proficient** The best of you may reach this point.
    * Sees situations holistically rather than as aspects
    * Perceives deviations from normal patterns
    * Uses maxims for guidance, whose meanings are contextual
1. **Expert**
    * No longer relies on rules, guidelines or maxims
    * Intuitive grasp of situations
    * Analytic approach used only in novel situations

### Communication

Communicate early and often. If you are sick, running late, have to take care of a car, etc... ping me directly and as early as possible. Failing to do so will only hurt your progress in this class.

You should already have been invited to the [Raleigh Slack site.](https://tiyraleigh.slack.com/messages) If not, let me know. Be sure to follow these channels:

* ral\_apr\_java\_2016
* ral\_apr\_2016

Feel free to self organize in Slack too.

### Time Management

We are hardwired to need breaks every 90-120 minutes. Schedule your energy, not your time. Block out parts of your day for exercise, for reading (fiction), for cooking, for family.

Group similar activities. If you need to do emails, do them in batches. If you need to do an assignment, do it without looking around at websites, checking Facebook/Twitter, or reading emails.

In this class I will endeavor to switch topics every 45 minutes or so and take breaks between two 90 minute intervals.

### The Zone

Have you ever become so involved in some task that you lost track of time? Do you ever find that there are points when you are doing something - musicians will probably relate to this - where everything just comes together and seems to work perfectly? This is call [The Zone, or Flow.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))

When you are in The Zone is when you are the most productive, learn the fastest, and do your best work.

It can be difficult to get into the zone, and, once in the zone, it is very easy to fall out of the zone. It might take you 20 minutes to really enter the zone, but a single notification from your phone can knock you out of the zone. At this point you're looking at another 20 minutes to get back into the zone.

To get into the zone:

 * Find a quiet space
 * Remove distractions
 * Shut the door
 * Shut off notifications
 * Silence your phone
 * Close web pages
 * Shut off the TV
 * Focus on what you're doing

If you see someone you think is in the zone, please think twice about interrupting them.

### Important Stuff First

Don't let yourself get stuck on unimportant details. An application will work without a beautiful icon, but it won't work without functioning code.

### Class Schedule

* Lecture is from approximately 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM Monday through Thursday, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later.
* Lab time is from the end of lecture to 5 PM Monday through Thursday and all day on Fridays.
* We may have guest lectures; which will generally be on Friday mornings.
* Reviews with me will take place at scheduled times.
* IronPintsâ„¢ on select Fridays in the late afternoon at our local bars and offices!

### Office hours and one-on-one instruction

I will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at a minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with me. After hours, I _may_ be available in the classroom or in Slack, but keep in mind your time commitments and be sure to get help during the morning before lecture and during lab time.

You should plan on me _not_ being available after 5pm or on weekends. That said, you are welcome to try slackifying or emailing me if you need to. I might reply, but, then again, I might not. If I don't, it's nothing personal. I probably didn't see the message or didn't have the chance to reply. I'll get back to you the next day we're in class for sure.

Also, take note that my phone goes into Do Not Disturb mode at 9pm every night. 

### Holidays

Any holidays will be announced by the campus staff.

### Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop to class. We recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should feel urged to purchase is 8GB of RAM.

Your MacBook must be running the latest version of Mac OS, which is a free upgrade from the App Store.

We should have already had an install party to make sure you have everything installed that you will immediately need.

### GitHub

You should already have opened a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. If not, open one now. We will use Git and GitHub to manage and share our code, and to submit assignments.

### Policies

Your new career is starts now. Literally. You're not in school, you're doing your job. As such, I expect you to be professional in every respect. This includes:

 * Show up to work.
 * Show up to work on time.
 * Complete your work on time and to the best of your abilities.
 * Be proactive when challenges arise.
 * Treat each other and yourself with respect.

The following is reiterated from the "Student Bulletin" document. These are all part of the agreement that you signed with The Iron Yard when you enrolled:

**Don't Miss Class** - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. Don't miss any classes, if you can at all help it. We will be moving very fast, missing even a single class can be catastrophic! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

**Do Your Work** - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the day of its deadline. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

**Be Honorable** - You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code will not only render your homework unacceptable but will also prevent you from learning the material (and often from writing code that works). Copying homework can result in forfeiting career support.

**Treat Yourself and Others With Respect** - [Read and live the code of conduct.](https://online.theironyard.com/library/paths/44/units/94/lessons/437) I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally speaking, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Have an issue with someone? If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, as we genuinely care for the well-being of our students.
