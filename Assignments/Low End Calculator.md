## Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new repository named "TIY-low-end-calculator".

## Instructions

* Write a program that uses Scanner to read user input.
* Prompt the user for a number.
* Prompt the user for an operation, one of "+", "-", "*", or "/".
* Prompt the user for another number.
* Calculate the answer and output it. For example, if the input is "1", "+", and "1", output "2".

### Hints

* The Scanner class has methods can can be used to read numbers. But, be warned: If the input isn't actually a number it will blow up.
* Scanner also has methods to tell you if the user did input a number or not. You could use this to check the input before you read it.

## Beast Mode

* Loop. Don't automatically stop the program. Make the user hit ctrl-c to quit.
* If the user provides bad input tell them so and prompt them again until they provide valid input.
