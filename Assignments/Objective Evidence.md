## Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new repository named "TIY-Objective-Evidence". 

## Instructions

We spent time going over how to create and instantiate a class. For this assignment, come up with five of your own examples. Each class should have comments explaining what the class and properties represent. 

Create a `Main` class with a `main` method that instantiates two _different_ instances of each object and outputs a description of each instance to the console. Next, pick one instance of each class and change its state. Output the updated description of these objects to the console.

Comment your code heavily to explain exactly what you are doing.

Push your code to your repository and submit the link in Tiyo.
