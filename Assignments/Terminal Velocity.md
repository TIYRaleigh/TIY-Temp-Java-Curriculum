## Create a GitHub Repository

For each assignment in this class I want you to create a _new_ repository in GitHub with a corresponding name. For example, this assignment is named "Terminal Velocity". You should create a new repository named "TIY-Terminal-Velocity". 

When you finish assignments you can submit a link to the corresponding repository in The Iron Yard Online (Tiyo).

## Instructions

This assignment is to be done (almost) entirely in the terminal. Don't cheat! In fact, don't clear your terminal history while you're working.

1. Create a directory where you will keep your projects for this class. I recommend a directory named `Projects` in your home directory.
2. Clone the GitHub repository you created for this assignment into your projects directory. This should create a new directory for this assignment.
3. List the contents of your projects directory and use the redirect operator to output the results to a file named `list-projects-directory.txt` in the assignment's directory.
3. In the assignment's directory use one of the command line text editors to create a new file. Write your favorite family-friendly joke in the new file and save it as `joke.txt`.
5.  Output your current working directory to a file named `workingDirectory.txt` in the assignment's directory.
6. Copy your `hosts` file into the assignment's directory.
7. There is a command called `date` that is not covered in the class materials. Use a command line tool to figure out how the `date` command works.
8. Using the `date` command, output the number of seconds since the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) to a file named `date.txt`.
9. List only the files with a `.txt` file extension and output the results into a file named `list of txt files.txt`.
10. Create a new file named `where-is-my-java.txt` and write into it the path to the `java` and `javac` executables. Please make it clear which is which.
10. Add all of these files into the Git staging area.
11. Commit these files. Be sure to provide a meaningful commit message.
12. Copy and paste your command history from terminal into a new file named `terminal-history-for-this-assignment.txt`
13. Commit this file too. Again, remember to give a meaningful commit message.
14. Push your changes into your remote repository on GitHub.
15. Submit the path to your Github repository for this assignment on Tiyo.
