## Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new repository named "TIY-Methodically-Learning".

## Instructions

Copy the classes you wrote for the Objective Evidence project into this project. For each of the classes you made yesterday, write constructors, setters, and getters. Update your `main` method to use these constructors and methods.

* In each class, write a constructor that sets all of its fields.
* In each class, write setters and getters for all of its fields.
* In each class, make at least one setter method contain an if statement that makes it enforce some kind of constraint.

## Beast Mode

Refactor your if statements so the code inside the parenthesis is moved into its own method.
