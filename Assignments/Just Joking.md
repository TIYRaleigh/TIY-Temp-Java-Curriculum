## Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new repository named "TIY-Just-Joking". 

## Instructions

This is just like the Hello World assignment, only this time with IntelliJ and a bit more amusing.

1. Use IntelliJ to create a project.
2. Make a class named `Joke`. This class should output your penultimate favorite family friendly joke.
3. Run it in IntelliJ.
4. [Take a screenshot of IntelliJ with the Joke output.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) Copy the image file into the root of your project.
5. Add the whole project to git and push it to Github.
